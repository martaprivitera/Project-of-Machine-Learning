# Project of Machine Learning

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Bodyâ€™s tissues and organs can be seriously damaged and some complications can be life-threatening over time.
What are the causes of Diabetes? Is it possible to predict with classification models whether a person is likely or unlikely to have Diabetes? The answers to these questions are at the center of the "Diabetes Prediction Competition" launched by the Kaggle Community Competitions hosted by ML GDEs or TFUGs, sponsored by Google Developers. Per doctors, the most common forms of diabetes are: being overweight, obesity, physi- cal inactivity, insuline resistance, genes and family history, genetic mutations and hormonal diseases. 
The aim of the present work is the realization of a model of classification capable of correctly cataloguing whether a person suffers of Diabetes or not on the basis of a few physical quantities in the dataset provided.

## Content

For this project, we developed a pipeline using KNIME and divided the workflow into separate files:

- Training set_Team09.knwf: This file handles the model training phase using a designated training set.
- Deployment set_Team09.knwf: This file manages the testing phase using a dedicated test set.
